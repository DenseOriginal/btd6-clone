# Tower Defense Game - Exam Project

This project is a tower defense game that uses physical tower and wall placement on a screen. A camera captures the positions of the towers and walls, and enemies and bullets are displayed on the surface screen.

## Game Objective

The objective of the game is to defend your base from waves of enemies that will spawn and make their way towards your base. You will need to strategically place towers and walls to block the path of the enemies and defeat them before they reach your base.

## Game Mechanics

### Tower Placement

To place a tower, you will need to physically place it on the screen. The camera will detect the position of the tower and it will be displayed on the screen. Different towers have different abilities and strengths, so you will need to choose the right combination of towers to defend your base.

### Wall Placement

Walls can also be placed on the screen to block the path of enemies. Walls can be upgraded to be stronger and longer, which will help to slow down the enemies.

### Enemies

Enemies will spawn at certain intervals and will make their way towards your base. They will follow the path that you have set for them, so it is important to strategically place your towers and walls to block their path.

### Bullets

Towers will shoot bullets at the enemies to defeat them. Each tower has a different firing rate and strength, so you will need to choose the right towers to defeat the enemies.

### Levels

There are multiple levels in the game, each with increasing difficulty. You will need to defeat all the waves of enemies in each level to progress to the next level.

## Technical Requirements

To set up the game, you will need the following:

- A screen with a camera mounted on top
- Towers and walls with markers on the bottom
- A computer with the game software installed

The camera will capture the position of the towers and walls, and the game software will use this information to display the towers and walls on the screen. The game software will also generate the enemies and bullets and display them on the screen.

## Conclusion

This tower defense game is an innovative and engaging way to combine physical placement with digital gameplay. With its multiple levels and strategic gameplay, it is sure to provide hours of entertainment.
